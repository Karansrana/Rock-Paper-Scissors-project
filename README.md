# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in Python.  
The program uses ASCII art for each move, takes user input, and lets the computer pick a random move.  
It then compares both choices and declares a winner!

## Features
- Classic Rock, Paper, Scissors gameplay
- ASCII art for a fun console experience
- Input validation (alerts user if an invalid choice is entered)
- Random computer choice for fair play

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user to choose between **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The choices are displayed using ASCII art.
4. The winner is determined based on traditional Rock–Paper–Scissors rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Scissors beats Paper  
   - Paper beats Rock  
   - Same choice = Draw
